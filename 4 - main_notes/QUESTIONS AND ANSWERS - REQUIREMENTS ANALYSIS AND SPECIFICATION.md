**What is the difference between requirements analysis and specification? What are the**
**Important activities that are carried out during requirements analysis and specification**
**Phase? What is the final outcome of the requirements analysis and specification phase?**

Fter requirements gathering is complete, the analyst
Analyses the gathered requirements to form a clear
Understanding of the exact customer requirements and to
Weed out any problems in the gathered requirements. It
Is natural to expect that the data collected from various
Stakeholders to contain several contradictions, ambiguities,
And incompleteness, since each stakeholder typically
Has only a partial and incomplete view of the software.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify all the problems
In the requirements and resolve them through further
Discussions with the customeR

Then refer to the requirement analysis canvas to see the steps 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the analyst has gathered all the required information regarding the software to be
Developed, and has removed all incompleteness, inconsistencies, and anomalies from the
Specification, he starts to systematically organise the requirements in the form of an SRS
Document. The SRS document usually contains all the user requirements in a structured
Though an informal form.
Among all the documents produced during a software development life cycle, SRS
Document is probably the most important document and is the toughest to write. One
Reason for this difficulty is that the SRS document is expected to cater to the needs of a
Wide variety of audience

Refer to the canvas for requirement analysis


**Consider the following requirement for a software to be developed for controlling
A chemical plant. The chemical plant has a number of emergency conditions. When
Any of the emergency conditions occurs, some prespecified actions should be taken.
The different emergency conditions and the corresponding actions that need to be
Taken are as follows:
214 Fundamentals of Software Engineering
(a) If the temperature of the chemical plant exceeds T 1°C, then the water shower
Should be turned ON and the heater should be turned OFF.
(b) If the temperature of the chemical tank falls below T 2°C, then the heater should
Be turned ON and the water shower should be turned OFF.
(c) If the pressure of the chemical plant is above P 1, then the valve v 1 should be
OPENED.
(d) If the chemical concentration of the tank rises above M , and the temperature of
The tank is more than T 3°C, then the water shower should be turned ON.
(e) If the pressure rises above P 3 and the temperature rises above T 1°C, then the
Water shower should be turned ON, valves v 1 and v 2 are OPENED and the alarm
Bells sounded.
Write the requirements of this chemical plant software in the form of a decision
Table.25. Draw a decision tree to represent the processing logic of the chemical plant controller
Described in question 24.**

**Express the decision making involved in the following withdraw cash function of a
Bank ATM using a decision table.
To withdraw cash, first a valid customer identification is required. For this, the
Customer is prompted to insert his ATM card in the card checking machine. If his
Card is found to be invalid, the card is ejected out along with an appropriate message
Displayed. If the card is verified to be a valid card, the customer is prompted to type
His password. If the password is invalid, an error message is shown and the customer
Is prompted to enter his password again. If the customer enters incorrect password
Consecutively for three times, then his card is seized and he is asked to contact the
Bank manager. On the other hand, if the customer enters his password correctly,
Then he is considered to have validly identified himself and is prompted to enter the
amount he needs to withdraw. If he enters an amount that is not a multiple of `100, he
Is prompted to enter the amount again. After he enters an amount that is a multiple
of `100, the cash is dispensed if sufficient amount is available in his account and his
Card is ejected; otherwise his card is ejected out without any cash being dispensed
Along with a message display regarding insufficient fund position in his account**

**Identify the functional and non-functional requirements in the following problem
Description and document them.
A cosmopolitan clock software is to be developed that displays up to 6 clocks with the
Names of the city and their local times. The clocks should be aesthetically designed.
The software should allow the user to change name of any city and change the time
Readings of any clock by typing c (for configure) on any clock. The user should also be
Able to toggle between a digital clock and an analog clock display by typing either d
(for digital) or a (for analog) on a clock display. After the stand-alone implementation
Works, a web-version should be developed that can be downloaded on a browser as
An applet and run. The clock should use only the idle cycles on the computer it runs.**

Part 1: Cosmopolitan Clock Software Requirements

Functional Requirements:

1. Display up to 6 clocks simultaneously
2. Show the name of the city and local time for each clock
3. Allow users to change the name of any city
4. Allow users to change the time readings of any clock
5. Provide a configuration option ('c' key) for each clock
6. Allow toggling between digital and analog clock display ('d' and 'a' keys)
7. Develop a standalone implementation
8. Develop a web version that can be downloaded as a browser applet

Non-Functional Requirements:

1. Aesthetic design of the clocks
2. Use only idle cycles on the computer it runs on
3. Web version should be compatible with browsers (implied)


**What do you understand by inconsistencies, anomalies, and incompletenesses in an
SRS document? Identify the inconsistencies, anomalies, and incompletenesses in the
Following requirements of an academic activity automation software of an educational
Institute:
“The semester performance of each student is computed as the average academic
Performance for the semester. The guardians of all students having poor performance
Record in the semester are mailed a letter informing about the poor performance of the
Ward and intimating that repetition of poor performance in the subsequent semester
Can lead to expulsion. The extracurricular activities of a student are also graded and
Taken into consideration for determination of the semester performance.**

Inconsistencies:

1. The requirements mention "poor performance" but don't define what constitutes poor performance. This could lead to inconsistent interpretations.

Anomalies:

1. The requirement states that guardians of students with poor performance are mailed, but it doesn't specify how this mailing process is integrated into the software system.

Incompletenesses:

1. The method for computing the "average academic performance" is not specified.
2. The weight or importance of extracurricular activities in determining semester performance is not defined.
3. The criteria for "poor performance" are not clearly stated.
4. The process for grading extracurricular activities is not explained.
5. The requirements don't specify how the system should handle cases where a student has already received a warning letter in the previous semester.
6. There's no mention of how the system should deal with missing data (e.g., if a student hasn't participated in any extracurricular activities).
7. The requirements don't address how the system should handle mid-semester transfers or incomplete semesters.
8. There's no mention of data privacy concerns or access control for sensitive student information.


**Identify any inconsistencies, anomalies, and incompleteness that are present in the
Following requirements that were gathered by interviewing the clerks of the CSE
Department for developing an academic automation software (AAS): “The CGPA of
Each student is computed as the average performance for the semester. The parents
Of all students having poor performance are mailed a letter informing about the poor
Performance of their ward and with a request to convey a warning to the student
That the poor performance should not be repeated**

Inconsistencies:

- There are no apparent inconsistencies in the given requirements.

Anomalies:

- The term "poor performance" is used but not defined. This is subjective and needs clarification.

Incompleteness:

- The method of calculating CGPA is not fully specified. It's unclear if it's a simple average or weighted.
- The threshold for "poor performance" is not defined.
- The frequency of CGPA calculation (e.g., after each semester, annually) is not specified.
- The process for obtaining and verifying parents' contact information is not mentioned.
- There's no mention of how to handle situations where contacting parents might not be possible or appropriate (e.g., adult students, privacy concerns).
- The system's response if a student's performance improves after a warning is not addressed.
- There's no mention of tracking or follow-up procedures after warnings are issued.
